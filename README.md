# ChessAI: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning in C++ (Metropolia Project)

This is a data structure and algorithm project for Metropolia University of Applied Science. A chess engine was built in c++ and the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning was used.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler 

### Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chessai.git
```


2. Go to the repository and make executable by running:
```
make
```

 an executable chess will then be created.

3. Run the executable
```
./chess
```


## Game Play

Three selections will be displayed. If you choose 1 and hit enter, AI will play against AI.
If you choose 2 you will play against the AI as white and if you choose 3, vice versa.

### Playing against the AI

At every turn, a list of possible moves will be displayed
```
Printing out all moves: 
S:c4c5
S:c4c6
S:c4c7
S:c4c3
S:c4b4
S:c4a4
S:c4d4
S:c4e4
...
```
